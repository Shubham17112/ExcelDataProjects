LOAN DISBURSEMENT Analysis
LOAN DISBURSEMENT Analysis
Jun 2025 - Jun 2025Jun 2025 - Jun 2025
I developed a Loan Disbursement Analysis dashboard for a fictional microfinance institution, FinTrust Microfinance, as part of a project to demonstrate data visualization and business analytics skills using Power BI.

Note: This project was created for learning and demonstration purposes only. FinTrust Microfinance is a dummy client.

Key tasks completed:
Visualized monthly loan disbursements (EUR) for the last 6 months using line/column charts.

Designed a loan officer-wise breakdown showing both count of disbursed loans and total disbursement volume for the latest month.

Built a KPI card and donut chart to illustrate the Portfolio at Risk (PAR > 30 days) based on overdue loan data.

Integrated interactive slicers to filter data by branch_key, product_key, and loan_officer_user_code.

Applied DAX measures and proper data modeling to ensure accuracy and responsiveness in Power BI visuals.
